<h1>Parsers</h1>
As of Apache Tika 2.0, there are three parser packages.
<ol>
    <li>tike-parser-modules: basic parsers -- java only, no native code, no parsers that require rest calls</li>
    <li>tike-parsers-extended: extended parsers -- allowed: native code and parsers that require rest calls, heavy dependencies</li>
    <li>tika-parsers-ml: parsers/recognizers that rely on machine learning and/or natural language processing</li>
</ol>
<p>
The <i>tika-parser-modules</i> modules are packaged as one in <i>tika-parsers</i>.  The tika-app and tika-server jars
depend on <i>tika-parsers</i>.  If you need an extended-parser or an ml parser, you're responsible for adding
those jars to your classpath.
