<!-- This is the OWL 2 Namespace Document, sometimes
     called the "owl.owl" file.

     For some commentary about its creation, see
     http://www.w3.org/2007/OWL/wiki/Owl2DotOwlDevel

     This was created from the 16 Oct 2009 version of
     that page, with the turtle-to-rdf/xml conversion
     done by cwm, and the conversion to XML entity
     references done by hand. The GRDDL triple and
     namespace have also been added by hand

     The real OWL 1 and OWL 2 namespace is:
